# Allegro placeholder model (Phase-0)

This repository ships a lightweight Allegro-inspired MJCF (`allegro_phase0.xml`) for
Phase-0 RL plumbing and diagnostics.

It is **not** an official Allegro hand model. Replace this file with your licensed or
official asset while preserving joint names in `robot_cfg.py`.
